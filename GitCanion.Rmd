## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
tiro <- function(d,h, col, add = TRUE){
  a <- -h/(d/2)^2 
  b <- 4*h/d
  c <- h+a*(d/2)^2
  
  curve(a*x^2+b*x+10+c, from = 0, to = d, add = add, col = col)
}
tiro(1000,10, "green", FALSE)
tiro(100,10, "blue")
tiro(100,5, "red")
```
